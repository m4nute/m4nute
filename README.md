Hey! I'm Manu. For the past year I've been working for multiple start-ups across North America and Europe as a Full-Stack developer (front-end heavy), specializing in building web applications / MVPs from scratch, and turning their ideas into great and performant UIs. 

I focus on SvelteKit and Next.js/React development, alongside TypeScript, TailwindCSS and popular libraries, such as ShadcnUI and OpenAI API for AI integrations. I also enjoy diving deep into new technologies and the more technical side of a product/solution.

I usually go for Upwork as my preferred working platform.
