👋🏻 Hello, I'm Manu. I've worked in multiple projects as a full-stack developer. I really enjoy what I do, from UI design to complex back-end architectures. That motivates me to deliver great results and keep improving. Lately I've been exploring the AI field, using vector databases, LLM's, and learning a lot everyday about the field.

Talking about me, I've loved puzzles and problem-solving since I was a kid, and never got tired of it. After coding everyday for the past 18 months, I've encountered hundreds of challenges and learned about things I didn't even know existed. The thrive to gain knowledge is what makes software exciting for me.

I'm currently open to new opportunities, so feel free to contact me through mgudinocontacto@gmail.com! I also like blogging and sharing my personal projects at mgudino.me if you're interested.
