I'm a Software Engineer focused on building attractive and performant full-stack applications, usually with Next.js and Typescript. Currently I'm developing & maintaining projects related to AI, such as TalkingCart.com. I believe I stand out for my problem-solving skills and a remarkable aptitude for acquiring knowledge. 

I'm always open to meet other people and learn from new experiences. Don't be afraid to reach me out at mgudinocontacto@gmail.com
